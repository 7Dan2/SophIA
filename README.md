# SophI.A
A simple file name generator raised for help naming files in accordance of specific professionnal needs.
Made in HTML5, bootstraped CSS, and Javascript.
Because of the unattented evolution of this tool, and stranges uncontroled behaviours occured, i will switch it to Angular and CSS grid.

Hey, i'm just a junior developper. 

The lastest version is 1.17.2.
